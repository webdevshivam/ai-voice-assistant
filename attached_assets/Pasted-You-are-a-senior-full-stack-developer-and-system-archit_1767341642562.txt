You are a senior full-stack developer and system architect.

I want you to design and help me build a real-time Hindi AI Voice Assistant using the MERN stack.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Real-time communication: Socket.IO
- Speech-to-Text: Web Speech API (Hindi – hi-IN)
- Text-to-Speech: Web Speech API (Hindi)
- Database: MongoDB (for logs, conversations, leads)
- Deployment: Frontend on Netlify, Backend on cloud server

### Core Functionality
1. The user can click a microphone button and speak in Hindi.
2. The app should listen in real time and convert speech to Hindi text.
3. The recognized text should be sent to the backend instantly using WebSockets.
4. The backend should act as the “brain”:
   - Understand the user intent.
   - Use a system prompt (example: “Act as a Hindi sales agent”).
   - Generate a Hindi response.
5. The backend should send the response text back to the frontend in real time.
6. The frontend should convert the response text into natural Hindi speech.
7. The assistant should pause listening while speaking and resume listening after speech ends.
8. The conversation should feel smooth, real-time, and natural.

### Prompt Control
- The user should be able to define a custom system prompt like:
  “Act as a telecaller and sell a pen.”
- This prompt should control the behavior of the AI for the entire session.

### Call Automation (Future Scope)
- The system should support calling phone numbers automatically.
- The AI should talk to the person on the call in Hindi.
- The conversation should be recorded, transcribed, and summarized.

### Data Storage
Store the following in MongoDB:
- User speech text
- AI responses
- Conversation timestamps
- Call summaries
- Lead status (interested / not interested)

### What I Want From You
1. Design the complete system architecture.
2. Suggest a clean folder structure for frontend and backend.
3. Explain the real-time data flow step by step.
4. Provide scalable code structure (not just snippets).
5. Mention performance, latency, and echo-handling strategies.
6. Suggest how this system can be extended into a SaaS product.

Explain everything clearly, step by step, in simple English.
